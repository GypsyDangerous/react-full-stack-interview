## How to use
1. Run `npm i` to install frontend depencies
2. Run `cd api` and `npm i` to install api depencies
3. Run `cd ..` to get back in the global directory
4. add a config.json file to the api directory and add a property called `ATLAS_URI` wich should be the URI for a mongodb atlas cluster
5. start the app with `npm start`
6. view the app on `http://localhost:3000`
7. use the api with `http://localhost:3001`

Since this will not be a public thing I don't mind sharing my mongodb atlas uri with you guys
